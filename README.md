# FastAI Practical Deep Learning Notebooks

This repository contains Juypter notebooks which attempt to recreate the Kaggle FastAI Practical Deep Learning Notebooks with additions of my own notes to aid understanding.

## Notebook 01: Is it a bird?

This notebook recreates the Kaggle "Is it a bird?" example using a local dataset of birds and forests.  
It demonstrates how to build a simple image classification model using FastAI, including data handling, model creation, training, and prediction.

You must manually add your images to 'bird' and 'forest' folders before running the notebook. Images can be any JPG files of birds or forest scenes.

## Notebook 02: Leaf Classifier?

This notebook builds on FastAI's lession 2 to create a leaf image classifier.  
The dataset used can be found here:  https://prod-dcd-datasets-cache-zipfiles.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bgmftbm8zt-1.zip
