    "The scenarios where a bear classification model might work poorly in production, due to structual or style differences in the training data include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bear might be obstructed by other objects in the image e.g. trees, other animals etc.  The model may fail because it only saw fully visible bears during training.\n",
    "- The bears might in unusual environments e.g. bears caged in a zoo as opposed to out in the wild.\n",
    "- If the training data contained high resolution, production images and the model is passed low-resolution or compressed images it could confuse the model.\n",
    "- The bear training dataset is highly biased towards one type of features (e.g. colour of the bear)"

    "Text models have major deficiencies in reliability and understanding beyond patterns in text.  This can manifest in:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Factual Accuracy/Hallucinations**\n",
    "\n",
    "A model can confidently generate false or misleading information.  For example, it might invent statistics, quotes or references that don't exist.  Deloitte was caught using AI in $290,000 report to help the Australian government crack down on welfare after a researcher flagged hallucinations.  Sydney University researcher of health and welfare law Chris Rudge said he alerted media outlets that the report was “full of fabricated references.”\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Understanding Context or World Knowledge**\n",
    "\n",
    "They don’t truly “know” the world; they rely on patterns in text.  Epistemia is a condition where linguistic plausibility replaces real evaluation and this happens alot with LLMs.  Technically, each answer given by an LLM is a probabilistic walk through a giant map of language, not a conclusion reached through reasoning or understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model does not know whether something is true.\n",
    "- It does not understand cause and effect.\n",
    "- It does not realise when it is uncertain.\n",
    "- It cannot decide not to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However because LLM answers *sound* plausible, users can be mistaken that the output is relevant to the question being asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Biases & Ethics**\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can inherit the biases present in their training data, reflecting the societal prejudices and imbalances encoded within. Bias in LLMs can lead to discriminatory outputs, perpetuating stereotypes and further marginalizing underrepresented groups.  An example of this is the use of LLMs in the workplace which are supposed to improve efficiency and fairness, but may also reproduce or amplify social biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Silicon Ceiling study examined the impact of LLMs on hiring by auditing race and gender bias in OpenAI’s GPT-3.5.  Researchers conducted two studies using names typically associated with different races and genders:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Resume evaluation\n",
    "2. Resume generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Study 1, GPT scores resumes with varied names across multiple occupations and evaluation criteria, revealing stereotype-based biases. In Study 2, GPT generates fictitious resumes, showing systematic differences: women’s resumes reflect less experience, while Asian and Hispanic resumes include immigrant markers.  These findings are just one example of evidence of bias in LLMs, there are many more."

    "1. LLMs can create unfair discrimination and representational and material harm by perpetuating stereotypes and social biases, i.e. harmful associations of specific traits with social identities.\n",
    "2. The risks associated with private data leaks or from LLMs correctly inferring private or other sensitive information. These risks stem from private data that is present in the training corpus and from advanced inference capabilities of LLMs.\n",
    "3. The risk associated with LLMs providing false or misleading information.\n",
    "4. The risks of users or product developers who try to use LMs to cause harm. This includes using LLMs to increase the efficacy of disinformation campaigns, to create personalised scams or fraud at scale, or to develop computer code for viruses or weapon systems.\n",

    "Situations where a model might make harmful mistakes are most prevalent in models that make predictions.  An example of this could be a model that predicts disease.  If the model generates a false positive, a patient may be incorrectly informed that they have a disease, causing them unnecessary stress and worry.  Alternatively if the model generates a false negative, a patient, who does in fact have a disease is told that they are disease free, meaning that medical treatment may be delayed.  In both of this scenarios, a model making a mistake could be very harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of mitigating this risk, is using Human In The Loop, where the model assists humans e.g. by making a prediction on disease status, however a human actively reviews this prediction.  For machine learning use cases in a medical setting, abnormal test results could automatically be flagged for review by a doctor, speeding up diagnostics and reducing risk of patient harm."

    "In recommender systems, user/item profiles are established by analysing user engagements with items in the system. User engagement encompasses various actions such as ratings, likes, purchases, views, clicks, comments or any other interaction with items.  The ratings of items is a key data source used by recommender systems to provide personalised recommendations. There are several key downsides of directly using a deep learning model for recommendation systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Sparsity of User-Item Rating Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "This poses a significant obstacle for Recommender Systems, making it difficult to model user preferences effectively. This issue is particularly evident in collaborative filtering techniques, where the accuracy of user/item similarity calculations and latent factor identification are compromised. Therefore, the sparsity adversely affects the accuracy, coverage, scalability, and transparency of the recommendations.  Deep learning models can have trouble learning meaningful patterns when entries are sparse.\n",
